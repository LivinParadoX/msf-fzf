# MSF Fuzzy Use

Tired of endless tabbing to select a fitting Metasploit module ? Fzf to the rescue !

Fuzzy Use is a Metasploit plugin which alters the behavior of the "use" command.
If used with an argument, the "use" command will behave as usual. You can even still push tab a dozen times before finding the module you want, if that's your secret kink.
However, if used without any argument, the "use" command will pipe the list of all modules to fzf, allowing you to select a module in a more civilised manner.

# Installation

Put the plugin somewhere, then load it. Nothing fancy.
